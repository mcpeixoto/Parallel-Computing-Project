# Parallel-Computing-Project

Assignment for Parallel Computing Course for the Physics Engineering Bachelor's degree at UMinho University 2021/2022.

The assigment consisted in making an optimized & parallelized version of the **Bucket Sort** algorithm, written in **C**, provided by the professors. 

An improved sequential bucket sort was implemented and scrutinized using **OpenMP**, building up from the version provided by the professors on the basis of benchmarks performed by **Perf** and **PAPI**. This report also includes a parallel version of the algorithm which peak performed at **340x** when compared to the original code. Performance, when the dimensionality or the hardware is changed, was also recorded and critically analyzed.

Here you can find our **final report**, all of the **code** used, and even some **python scripts** used to automate the diferent experiments made on the [SeARCH Cluster](https://www4.di.uminho.pt/search/pt/).
